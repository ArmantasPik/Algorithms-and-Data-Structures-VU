# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-VU
Algorithms and Data Structures programs made in C, C++ during the second semester of Vilnius University Software Engineering studies.

First task: Abstract Data Structure. implementation of a queue

Second task: Partition problem. Algorithm that recursively solves a NP-complete problem of diving a group of weights into two groups which weigh almost or the same amount.

Third task: A simulation model that tries to find which data structure (arranged vector, non arranged vector or AVL binary search tree) is the most optimal to store books in a library.
